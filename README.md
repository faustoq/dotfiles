# my .dotfiles

This project is everything I need to feel at üè†  on **a brand new Macbook**, so I can start coding right away. üßë‚Äçüíª

- installing web browsers üåé, code editors ‚å®Ô∏è, Docker üê≥, latest PHP, NodeJS and Python üîß, Spotify üéß, some messaging apps üí¨ and a bunch of other stuff...
- install a list of global ***npm*** and ***composer*** packages üì¶
- customise and keep in sync `.bash_profile` and `.zshrc` files. ‚ö°Ô∏è

## About

Occasionally it comes time to change my Macbook. Once the new toy is unwrapped, instead of starting to play, the first thing I need to do is install an endless list of apps (and I often forget a few) and various customisations. Definitely a chore that  I prefer to avoid doing every time. 

This bash script handles everything in just over a couple of minutes thanks to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) üç∫
